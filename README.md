# Rock–Paper–Scissors (RPS) Game in Python

This project implements the classic **Rock–Paper–Scissors** game using Python.  
The project was developed as part of a **Data Science course**, with the goal of practicing
core Python fundamentals such as control flow, functions, dictionaries, user input handling,
and randomness.

## Game Rules

The rules of the game are as follows:

- Rock beats Scissors  
- Scissors beats Paper  
- Paper beats Rock  

The player selects one option, and the computer randomly selects another.
Points are awarded based on the outcome of each round.

- Win: the winner receives 1 point  
- Tie: both the player and the computer receive 1 point  
- Loss: the computer receives 1 point  

The game continues until **either the player or the computer reaches 3 points**.

## How the Game Works

1. The user is prompted to choose one of the following options:
   - `Rock`
   - `Paper`
   - `Scissors`
2. The computer randomly selects an option.
3. A short countdown simulates the round.
4. The game logic determines the winner using predefined rules.
5. Scores are updated and displayed after each round.
6. Once a score of 3 is reached, the final result is displayed and the game ends.

## Requirements

This project uses only Python standard libraries.

- Python 3.x

### Libraries Used
- `random`
- `time`

No external dependencies are required.  
No `pip install` is needed.
